# Face-Recognition-Eigenfaces-and-DLIB
 Implement and compare two approaches for face recognition - the classical Eigenfaces vs CNN based DLIB.


Here I explore two different methods for face recognition to compare classical and deep learning approaches. The first method will be a classical approach based on Eigenfaces, and the second will be a deep learning approach using DLIB.
